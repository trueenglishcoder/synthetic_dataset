# Synthetic Dataset: Metal Nuts Randomly Scattered in a Box

## Description
This synthetic dataset aims to address the problem of detecting metal nuts randomly scattered in a box, particularly focusing on identifying nuts that lie relatively flat. The dataset is designed to aid in the development and evaluation of algorithms for automated nut detection in industrial settings.
